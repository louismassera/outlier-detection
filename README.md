# Outlier Detection for Imbalanced Classification
## Data Case Study at Columbia, April 2018
- **Goal**: Use both unsupervised approach (PCA, t-SNE, K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, Elliptic Envelope, One Class SVM and Isolation Forest) and supervised methods (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to detect outliers from an imbalanced binary-classified dataset.
- Repository contains:
  - annthyroid.mat in **data** folder.
  - **outlier_detection.ipynb** that goes through all those algorithms with comments along the way.
